# Pycharm_projects

This repository is a draft of the PyCharm project files for the 100 Days of Python challenge. It contains the code I have written as I work through the exercises and projects in the challenge. I sometimes push my files here and commit changes as I make progress. Please note that this repository is a work in progress and the code may not be complete or fully functional. I welcome any feedback and suggestions for improvement.
